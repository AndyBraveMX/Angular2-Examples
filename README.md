# AngularExamples
My learning path of Angular, since creating a project to consume REST services

In this Repo you will find a project which:

-- Takes a math expression since an HTML input, invokes a TypeScript service to evaluate it and returns the result in a label.
-- Takes a math expression since an HTML input, invokes a java service exposed on REST with Spring, evaluates the expression and returns the result as JSON format to show in the label.
